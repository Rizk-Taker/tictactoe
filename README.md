README

This file represents a tic tac toe game for two players. When the game starts, the two players are asked for their names and subsequently assigned by flip of a coin the order in which they start and a mark of 'X' or 'O' to play the game. After the order is determined, the players always have an instructions section printed below the game, which is a 3x3 grid. 

The instructions provide a point of reference of where to place their marks. The goal of the game is to get 3 in a row of the same mark either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In total, there are 8 possible winning outcomes (3 horizontal, 3 vertical, and 2 diagonal). Whether there is a winner or the players tie, it will then ask if they would like to play again by responding 'yes', or pressing any key to exit the game.

I hope that you enjoy playing!
